Hi there! 👋 I'm Magda

I'm a passionate software developer with a drive for accessibility-first, beautifully crafted applications. Through my work, I’m on a mission to make the digital world more inclusive, ensuring no one is left behind due to barriers in technology.

🔍 My focus areas

Accessibility: Dedicated to improving inclusivity in web applications, from implementing accessibility tools to leading knowledge-sharing sessions.
Web Development: With hands-on experience in React, Next.js, Node, Docker, and AWS, I craft responsive, well-tested applications.
Optimization and Collaboration: I love working with cross-functional teams to optimize and deliver seamless, efficient user experiences.

🌲 Outside of computers

When I'm not immersed in code, you’ll find me outdoors, embracing the mud and grit while running or climbing. Whether it’s a tough trail run or scaling a new crag, my love for challenges extends beyond the screen.

Thanks for stopping by – let's make the web a better place together! ✨
